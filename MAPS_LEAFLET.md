# Maps Feature - Leaflet Implementation

## Overview

The Maps feature uses **Leaflet** - a completely free, open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps. No API keys, no costs, no usage limits!

## Features

### Map Display
- **Interactive Map**: Powered by Leaflet with OpenStreetMap tiles
- **Ticket Markers**: All tickets with addresses appear as markers
- **Popup Details**: Click markers to view ticket information
- **Auto-fit Bounds**: Map automatically adjusts to show all ticket locations
- **Free Geocoding**: Uses OpenStreetMap's Nominatim service

### Why Leaflet?

✅ **Completely Free**: No API keys, no credit card, no hidden costs
✅ **Open Source**: MIT-licensed, transparent and trustworthy
✅ **No Usage Limits**: Unlimited map loads and geocoding requests
✅ **Great Performance**: Lightweight and fast
✅ **Mobile Friendly**: Responsive and touch-optimized
✅ **Active Community**: Well-maintained with extensive documentation

## Setup

### Installation

The required packages are already installed:
```bash
npm install leaflet react-leaflet
```

### Configuration

**No configuration needed!** The Maps feature works out of the box with:
- OpenStreetMap for map tiles
- Nominatim for geocoding (converting addresses to coordinates)

## Usage

### Adding Addresses to Tickets

1. Navigate to the Tickets page
2. Create or edit a ticket
3. Fill in the "Address" field with a complete address
4. Save the ticket

**Address Format Tips:**
- Use complete addresses: "Kongens gate 1, 7011 Trondheim, Norway"
- Include city and postal code for best results
- Nominatim supports international addresses

### Viewing Maps

1. Click "Maps" in the navigation menu
2. Wait for geocoding to complete (takes ~1 second per address)
3. See all tickets with addresses displayed as markers
4. Click any marker to view ticket details in a popup
5. The map automatically fits all markers in view

### Map Interaction

- **Pan**: Click and drag the map
- **Zoom**: Use mouse wheel or +/- buttons
- **Markers**: Click to see ticket details
- **Popups**: Show ticket title, number, description, address, technicians, dates

## Technical Details

### Map Provider
- **Tiles**: OpenStreetMap (OSM)
- **License**: Open Database License (ODbL)
- **Attribution**: Automatically displayed on map

### Geocoding
- **Service**: Nominatim (OpenStreetMap's geocoder)
- **Rate Limit**: 1 request per second (automatically handled)
- **Free Tier**: Unlimited requests for legitimate use
- **Fair Use Policy**: Respect the service by not hammering it

### Performance

**Initial Load:**
- Fetches all tickets with addresses
- Geocodes each address sequentially (1 per second)
- For 10 tickets: ~10 seconds initial load
- Subsequent views: instant (coordinates cached in memory)

**Optimization Ideas:**
- Cache geocoded coordinates in database (future enhancement)
- Implement progressive loading for many tickets
- Add loading progress indicator

## Geocoding Service

### Nominatim Usage Policy

The app respects Nominatim's usage policy:
- Maximum 1 request per second (enforced with delays)
- User-Agent header should identify your application
- For heavy usage (>1000 requests/day), consider:
  - Running your own Nominatim instance
  - Caching geocoded results in database
  - Using commercial geocoding services

### Geocoding Limitations

**May fail for:**
- Incomplete addresses (e.g., just street name)
- Non-existent addresses
- Very new addresses not yet in OSM database
- Addresses with unusual formatting

**When geocoding fails:**
- Ticket won't appear on map
- Warning shown indicating failed addresses
- Original ticket data remains intact

## Troubleshooting

### Markers not appearing
- Check that tickets have valid addresses
- Verify address format is complete
- Look for geocoding errors in browser console
- Some addresses may take time to be added to OSM database

### Map not loading
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify internet connection (needed for tiles)
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Ensure Leaflet CSS is loading properly

### Slow initial load
- Expected behavior: 1 second per address
- Consider caching coordinates in database for production
- Loading time scales linearly with number of tickets

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Cache geocoded coordinates in database
- Add loading progress bar
- Custom marker colors by ticket status/priority
- Marker clustering for dense areas
- Route planning for technicians
- Filter tickets on map (by date, technician, department)
- Export map as image
- Offline map tiles (PWA feature)

### Performance Improvements
- Store lat/lng in ticket document
- Geocode only new/changed addresses
- Implement geocoding queue for bulk operations
- Add map data prefetching

## Cost Comparison

### Leaflet + OSM (Current)
- **Setup Cost**: $0
- **Monthly Cost**: $0
- **Per-request Cost**: $0
- **Usage Limits**: None (fair use)
- **Total Cost**: **FREE** ✅

### Google Maps (Previous)
- **Setup Cost**: $0
- **Free Tier**: $200/month credit
- **Map Loads**: $7/1000 after free tier
- **Geocoding**: $5/1000 after free tier
- **Potential Monthly Cost**: $50-500+ at scale

**Savings**: 100% - Using Leaflet eliminates all costs!

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify address format
3. Review Nominatim status
4. Check Leaflet documentation
5. Inspect network requests in DevTools

The Maps feature is designed to work reliably without any configuration or API keys!
