## Setup Required

### Google Maps API Key
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create/select a project
3. Enable these APIs:
   - Maps JavaScript API
   - Geocoding API
4. Create an API key
5. Add to `.env` file:
   ```
   REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

### Environment Variable
Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory:
```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your Google Maps API key
```

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `backend/models/Ticket.js` - Added address field

### Frontend
- `frontend/src/App.js` - Added Maps route
- `frontend/src/components/Navigation.js` - Added Maps link
- `frontend/src/pages/Tickets.js` - Added address field to forms
- `frontend/src/pages/Maps.js` - New Maps page component (created)
- `frontend/.env.example` - Environment variable template (created)

### Documentation
- `MAPS_SETUP.md` - Complete setup guide (created)

## How to Use

### Adding Addresses to Tickets
1. Go to Tickets page
2. Create or edit a ticket
3. Fill in the "Address" field (e.g., "Kongens gate 1, 7011 Trondheim, Norway")
4. Save the ticket

### Viewing Maps
1. Click "Maps" in the navigation menu
2. See all tickets with addresses as markers
3. Click markers to view ticket details
4. Use the info window to see:
   - Ticket title and number
   - Description
   - Address
   - Assigned technicians
   - Start/end dates

## Features Implemented

✅ Address field in ticket model
✅ Address input in ticket forms
✅ Maps page with Google Maps
✅ Geocoding of addresses to coordinates
✅ Interactive markers on map
✅ Info windows with ticket details
✅ Auto-fit bounds for all markers
✅ Refresh functionality
✅ Ticket counter
✅ Environment variable configuration
✅ Setup documentation
✅ Mobile responsive design

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented Yet)

Ideas for future development:
- Route planning for technicians
- Marker clustering for many nearby tickets
- Custom marker colors (by status/priority)
- Address autocomplete in forms
- Geocoding result caching
- Map filters (date, technician, department)
- Distance calculations
- Street view integration
- Print/export map views

## Notes

- The address field is **optional** - existing tickets without addresses won't appear on the map
- Geocoding happens in real-time when the Maps page loads
- Google Maps provides $200/month free tier (plenty for typical usage)
- API key should be kept secure and restricted to your domain in production
- Consider caching geocoded coordinates in the future to reduce API calls

## Testing

To test the feature:
1. Add your Google Maps API key to `.env`
2. Restart the development server
3. Create a ticket with an address
4. Navigate to the Maps page
5. Verify the marker appears at the correct location
6. Click the marker to see ticket details

## Deployment Notes

- Remember to add the `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` environment variable in your Render.com deployment settings
- The API key should be different for production (with proper domain restrictions)
- Monitor your Google Maps API usage in the Google Cloud Console
